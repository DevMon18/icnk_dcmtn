## Admin Side
link: [kioskmanagement.vercel.app]()
1. When the user **logged out** and when you **click the arrow back (browser)** it will go back to the previous page (Logged in account)
2. **Accounts** - feature takes too long to load (didn't load/needs browser refresh couple of times)

3.  When **updating** the images on the map, there is an error showed (An error occurred while updating the building.) Even though the internet connection is stable
4. When navigating the path and **changing** the **floor levels** the path line would stay to its direction even though there is no room specified
